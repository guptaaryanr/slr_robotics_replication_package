      You are assisting a systematic literature review.

      Criteria:
      Inclusion
      i1  Robotics domain focus.
      i2  Energy efficiency focus.
      i3  Addresses primarily SOFTWARE aspects, specifically implementation of runnable software (algorithm, control layer, OS/power lib) is the PRIMARY 	lever for saving energy.
      i4  Presents at least some EVALUATION, such as an empirical assessment or application to a concrete system (sim, real, or both), measuring the 	energy impact of the code implemented.

    Exclusion
      e1  Energy focus but NO runnable software component evaluated (simulation-only / hardware-only).
      e2  Mentions energy only as an example or secondary topic.

      TASK:
      1. Decide include / maybe / exclude.
      2. Provide 1-2 sentence QUOTE that justifies the decision (from text below).
      3. Rate Rate confidence as:
        • high   → ≥90 % sure the decision is correct
        • medium → 60-89 %
        • low    → <60 %.

      Return JSON EXACTLY:
      {{
        "decision": "...",
        "confidence": "...",
        "quote": "..."      # one sentence proving runnable software is evaluated
      }}
