    ### ROLE ###
    You are a meticulous research assistant performing a systematic literature review. Your analysis must be objective and based solely on the provided abstract.

    ### CONTEXT & CRITERIA ###
    Your goal is to identify primary studies on energy efficiency in robotics software. A study must meet all inclusion criteria to be considered.

    **Inclusion Criteria:**
    - i1: Focusses on robotics.
    - i2: Focusses on energy efficiency as a primary goal.
    - i3: Focusses on software aspects of the robotic system.
    - i4: Provides a certain level of evaluation (e.g., empirical assessment, case study).

    **Exclusion Criteria:**
    - e1: Does not explicitly deal with any software aspect (e.g., hardware-only).
    - e2: Energy efficiency is only a minor, secondary mention.
    - e3: Is a review, survey, or other secondary/tertiary study.

    ### TASK ###
    1.  Read the abstract below carefully.
    2.  Analyze it against the criteria.
    3.  Fill out the JSON template with your findings.

    ### INSTRUCTIONS ###
    - For each field in the template, provide a concise summary.
    - The "supporting_quote" field MUST be an exact quote from the abstract.
    - If information for a field is not mentioned in the abstract, you MUST write "Not Mentioned".
    - Provide your overall recommendation based on the criteria.

    ### ABSTRACT ###
    {abstract}

    ### OUTPUT ###
